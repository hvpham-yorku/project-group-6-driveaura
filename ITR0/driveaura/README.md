DriveAura: Project Overview and Documentation
Project Description
DriveAura is a web-based learning platform designed to assist individuals preparing for Canadian driving tests (G1, G2, G, M1, M2) and those seeking to refresh their knowledge of road safety. The platform utilizes a data-driven approach to education: users begin with a diagnostic quiz which generates a personalized report. This report identifies specific areas for improvement and assigns targeted learning modules featuring instructional content, visual aids, and short assessments. Users are required to demonstrate adequate knowledge before progressing to subsequent sections.

To improve engagement and motivation, DriveAura incorporates a gamification system known as "Aura points." These points are tracked and displayed on a leaderboard, allowing users to compare progress with friends or the global user base.

Potential Customers
First-time license applicants (G1/M1)

High school and post-secondary students

Drivers with suspended or expired licenses seeking re-qualification

Licensed drivers seeking refreshers or confidence-building exercises

Marketable Features
1. Aura Points and Gamification
The platform rewards consistency and accuracy. Users earn Aura points for logging in and successfully completing modules. To encourage careful study, the system may include mechanics where restarting modules or failing assessments results in a loss of points. This data is displayed on a competitive leaderboard.

2. New-Generation Driving Modules
With the industry shifting toward Electric Vehicles (EVs) and autonomous technologies, DriveAura includes specialized modules on regenerative braking systems, semi-autonomous driving features, and EV-specific safety. This addresses a gap in traditional driver education.

3. Psychological and Stress Management
Driving is often a high-stress activity. DriveAura includes a road rage and stress simulation component. Users are presented with stressful road scenarios and earn points for selecting de-escalation strategies. This prepares users for the emotional aspects of driving, not just the technical rules.

4. Interactive Hazard Simulation
The platform features a video-based simulation from a driver's point of view. Users must identify hazards in real-time—such as a pedestrian entering the road or a vehicle merging—by interacting with the platform at the exact moment a hazard is spotted. This builds reaction-based skills and situational awareness beyond rote memorization.

Competitive Analysis
DriveAura distinguishes itself from existing products by offering a full-system learning experience rather than simple test preparation. While platforms like Ontario G1 Practice Test (g1.ca), tests.ca, and Quizlet provide practice questions and flashcards, DriveAura integrates:

Real-time reaction testing

Psychological preparedness

Modern vehicle technology education

A unified gamified ecosystem
